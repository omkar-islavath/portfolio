<h3>What it teaches</h3>
<p>
  !! Cricket it is the name which has the power awaken any person even if he is
  in coma <br />
  it teaches more than what schooling cant teach you in 10+ years ,it just an
  pure emotion to who plays it or watches it.
  <br />
  Even the childrens who didnt remeber what they learnt in class they just
  remeber the scores or any cricket info with just blink ont it <br />It is an
  emotion just teaches to never give up!!!!
